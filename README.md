Angular Part :

This project is developed using Laravel and Angular, and it is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing student data.

Angular, on the other hand, is a widely-used JavaScript framework developed by Google. It is primarily used for building dynamic single-page applications (SPAs). Angular provides a comprehensive set of tools and features for managing application state, handling data binding, and creating reusable components. It follows a component-based architecture, which promotes code modularity and reusability.

In this Laravel and Angular project, the main purpose is to perform CRUD operations on student data. This includes creating new student records, retrieving and displaying existing student information, updating student details, and deleting student records from the database. The project leverages the Laravel backend to handle the server-side operations and the Angular frontend to provide an interactive user interface for managing student data.

By combining the strengths of Laravel and Angular, this project aims to deliver a robust and efficient solution for managing student information through a user-friendly interface.
